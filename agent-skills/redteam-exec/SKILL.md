description: Run a compliant Chelis red-team round, or send a local repair back to the standing reviewer for verification before push. A round starts with a fresh local subagent working an inline brief against the pushed head, then keeps that reviewer alive through the local repair loop. Anything else is not a red team.

# Red Team Exec

Use this skill when the user asks for a red team, an adversarial review, a fresh-context
validation pass, or verification of a fix that a red team reported.

## Repository Contract

1. A **round** starts with a fresh local subagent reviewing from the inline brief below
   and continues through the repair loop. **Verification** is the reviewer that reported
   a finding checking the exact local repair commit before it is pushed. Neither is a
   main-thread pass, and a phase or pull request is red-teamed only when the subagent
   actually ran the validation work.
2. Keep the reviewer alive while the author and reviewer serially hand off the supplied
   worktree. A confirmed in-scope P0 or P1 earns a fresh round after the current round
   closes and its exact verified repair head is pushed, subject to the cap below.
   Unmigrated assertions, old comments, minor documentation drift, and P2-or-lower
   findings do not alone earn another round. A rebase with substantial conflicts or
   semantic overlap gets a targeted red team focused on the overlap; it needs no
   separate permission and does not count toward the fresh-round cap.
3. A pull request gets at most three fresh rounds by default; a fourth needs the user's
   explicit approval. A prose-only pull request, design documents included, gets one,
   and a second needs the same approval. Rounds run from any platform count, and the
   pull request's round record is the counter. Verification does not count against the
   cap; the end-of-pull-request round does.
4. Context budgets and time limits are optional, with no default. When set, include
   them in the brief. The reviewer reports what it has when an explicit limit is
   reached; an unfinished check is "unvalidated", not a finding.
5. The initial head is pushed before the round starts, so CI runs while the first review
   runs. Repair commits remain local until the standing reviewer is satisfied. Push the
   exact verified repair head once after the round closes; CI then validates that head.
   CI is watched by at most one background waiter, never a foreground sleep or poll loop.
6. If every local subagent path is unavailable, state that red-team validation is
   blocked. Do not substitute an external agent CLI or main-thread validation.

## Finding Discipline

- Every pull request, documentation-only work included, needs at least one compliant
  round before it merges. Only a confirmed in-scope P0/P1 blocks, and the standing
  reviewer's local verification closes the finding inside the current round. A
  confirmed in-scope P0/P1 then earns a fresh round on the pushed repair head, subject
  to the cap.
- Absent an in-scope P0 or P1 finding, scale rounds to the change. Minor updates, bug
  fixes, and textual changes do not inherently merit another round. If another change
  already requires a push or CI rerun, include every known P2-or-lower repair in that
  local candidate before the standing reviewer closes the round.
- A rebase with substantial conflicts or semantic overlap gets a targeted red team
  focused on that overlap and does not count toward the cap. A rebase with no such
  overlap does not automatically require review.
- Classify every finding against the pull request's stated scope. Mere discovery,
  including an unrelated pre-existing spec/implementation mismatch, does not bring it
  into scope. Do not repair an out-of-scope finding in the pull request; link its
  existing issue or file one when it is not already tracked.
- A gate repair may correct, remove, or narrow existing pull-request content. It must
  not add design scope, implementation responsibilities, inventories, mechanisms, or
  promises merely to absorb a finding. State every claim at the granularity its oracle
  proves; an unbounded universal claim invites sampling in every round.
- Record the class of every finding in the round record. When two consecutive rounds
  report the same class, or replace a repaired finding with a different class, stop
  patching witnesses: change the representation, the oracle, the claim, or the brief
  before another round. Do not keep expanding the pull request to satisfy a moving
  brief.
- Separability sizes a pull request. Slices that must ship together are commits
  inside one pull request, and slices that can ship apart are separate pull requests.
  About 1,000 hand-written changed lines, regenerated artifacts excluded, is the point
  at which the author owes a sentence justifying one shippable slice, not a threshold.
  Size is in scope for the round: the ratio of cases a claim covers to cases its tests
  prove is the reportable signal, and a low one is a finding whatever the line count.

## Minimum Deliverable

- findings ordered by severity, each with its class and its in-scope or out-of-scope
  classification, with linked issue status for every out-of-scope defect
- exact commands run for every P0, P1, and P2; a P3 is one line with no reproduction
- coverage against the in-scope claims and the active acceptance oracle
- exact reviewed commit and final worktree status; deadline met or missed when one was set
- explicit note of anything unvalidated

## Validation Discipline

- run code and commands, not just source inspection
- add adversarial probes where coverage is thin
- verify positive and negative cases
- check examples, docs, and CLI behavior against shipped behavior

## Hello-Chelis Round And Handoff

1. Confirm the initial candidate is committed and pushed, count prior rounds
   against the cap, and retire only your stale or failed handles. Keep a
   reporting reviewer available for verification. Start a fresh local reviewer
   through the platform with a self-contained brief; record finding classes
   in the PR. Do not substitute an external agent CLI.
2. For every worktree handoff, run `git rev-parse HEAD` and
   `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` in that worktree. Run
   `git worktree list --porcelain` from the shell repository. Inspect
   `ps -axo pid,ppid,command` for `chelis`, `python`, `uv`, `pytest`, `docker`,
   and gate processes; use `lsof -a -d cwd -p PID` when ownership is unclear.
   Paste the timestamp and command output into the brief. A dirty tree,
   concurrent owner, or uncertain process scope forbids reuse. Use an isolated
   worktree or target in that case. Author and reviewer never write or build
   in the same worktree concurrently. A reviewer planning probes that mutate
   tracked source uses its own worktree.
3. A new-round brief names the PR and round, pushed SHA, changed paths,
   bounded claims, worktree and target, handoff evidence, report budget,
   delivery channel, executed positive and negative probes, and restoration
   check. A verification brief goes to the same standing reviewer and names
   the unpushed repair SHA, finding class, changes since its report, handoff
   evidence, reproduction commands, and requested closed/not-closed result.
   Restore temporary probes before either handoff.
4. Consolidate repairs in a local commit and have that reviewer verify the
   exact unpushed head. Repeat until the reviewer is satisfied. Push that head
   only after the round closes, then record its CI evidence. If the standing
   reviewer becomes unavailable, run its exact reproduction and record
   "reviewer unavailable"; this cannot replace a fresh round owed after an
   in-scope P0 or P1.
